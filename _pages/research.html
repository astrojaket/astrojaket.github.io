<h1>My Research</h1>
<p>Welcome to the research section. Here you can learn about my academic research projects, studies, and interests. I am currently focusing on several exciting areas of astrophysics and machine learning applications in astronomy.</p>

<h2>Current Research</h2>
<p>My current research explores a variety of topics, including exoplanets, machine learning, and the application of computational methods to astrophysical problems. Below are some of the main areas of focus:</p>

        <h3>Gas Giant Exoplanets</h3>
        <p>My research in gas giant exoplanets focuses on their atmospheric composition, their formation mechanisms, and their habitability potential. We use observational data from space telescopes like Hubble and JWST to model their climates and identify signs of life.</p>

    <div class="research-text" style="flex: 1; max-width: 45%; padding-right: 20px;">
        <h3>Terrestrial Exoplanets</h3>
        <p>I am also studying terrestrial exoplanetsâ€”planets that are similar in size and composition to Earth. This involves both the search for Earth-like planets in the habitable zone and the analysis of their potential for sustaining life.</p>
